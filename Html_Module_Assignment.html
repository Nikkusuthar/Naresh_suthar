    <!-- <p>Question 1</p> -->
        <p>Are the HTML tags and element The same things?</p>
     <p> = Tags are labels you use to mark up the begining and end of an element.

    All tags have the same format: they begin with a less-than sign " &lt;" and end with a greater-than sign "&#62;".
    
    Generally speaking, there are two kinds of tags - opening tags: and closing tags. The only difference between an opening tag and a closing tag is the forward slash "/". You label content by putting it between an opening tag and a closing tag. <br>
    Exe.  &lt;h1&#62;   &lt;/h2&#62;<br>
   Element is the basic building block of HTML and is typically made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.

Almost all HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag. These tags surround the text that will display on the web page. For example, to write a paragraph of text, you write the text to display on the page and then surround it with these tags:</p></li>

      <!-- <p>Question 2</p> -->
    <li><p>What are tags and attributes in HTML?</p>
     <p> = Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with  &lt;  symbol and end with &#62;symbol. Whatever written inside  &lt;and &#62; are called tags. <br> 
     Exe. &lt;b&#62;  &lt;/b&#62; <br>
     Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside. <br>

     <li><p>What are void elements in HTML?</p>
    <p> = Most of the HTML elements are surrounded by start and end tags to specify the starting and end of the element. There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are called void elements. Void elements doesn’t have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. <br> Example.&lt;br&#62; &lt;hr&#62; &lt;img&#62; &lt;link&#62; &lt;area&#62; &lt;source&#62; &lt;embed&#62; &lt;base&#62; etc.  </p></li><hr>

        <!-- <p>Question 5</p> -->
        <li><p>What are different types of lists in HTML?</p><p> = HTML Lists help to display a list of information semantically. There are three types of lists in HTML:

                elements? </p><p> = The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.  </p></li><hr>
                <!-- <p>Question 8</p> -->
                <li><p>What are the various formatting tags in HTML? </p><p>= Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text: <br>

                    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). <br>
                    
                    - Two commonly used block elements are:  &lt;p&#62; and  &lt;div&#62;. <br>

            <li><p>What is the use of an iframe tag?</p><p> = The &lt;iframe&#62;  tag specifies an inline frame. <br>

            - The &lt;span&#62; tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. <br>
            
           - The &lt;span&#62; tag is much like the &lt;div&#62; element, but &lt;div&#62; is a block-level element and &lt;span&#62; is an inline element. <br>

        <!-- <p>Question 18</p> -->
        <li><p>What is SVG? </p><p> = SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. <br>
        <ul>
            <li>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics</li>
            <li>SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Hypertext: Hypertext refers to the “text wrapped within a text.” It is very similar to hyperlinks and contains an underlying text that, when clicked, redirects to a new webpage.</li>
                <li>Markup language: A markup language is not necessarily a programming language. Instead, it is used to apply formatting and layout to a simple text document. This leads to more interactive and dynamic text content.</li>
